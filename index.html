                    <p><em>Web Developer and Founder of <strong>RunByAalz</strong></em></p>
                    <p> I am an aspiring Software Engineer.
                        I have a background in the Tourism Industry with 10 years work experience. 
                        During the pandemic, I was inspired to do a Software Engineering course. 
                        I completed the course at Wethincode_ in 2022. 
                        I learnt and built projects in various programming languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL. 
                        In my final semester, I chose the QA elective where I was exposed to C# while using Nunit framework, Gauge and Selenium. 
                        I used Miro boards and GitLab for planning and held daily or weekly standups to implement an agile environment. 
                        I have the ability to work well in a team as well as individually. 
                        I am willing to learn and always willing to go the extra mile for the team.
